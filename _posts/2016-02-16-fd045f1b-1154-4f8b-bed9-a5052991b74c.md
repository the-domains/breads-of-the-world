**_Lenny loves baguettes aka it's good to have friends_**

When Lemmy was walking the park today he decided to call to say hi. Things we spoke about...(1) Runnign for council election (2) opening a brad shop (2) wealth inequality (3) moving house.

I had to cut Lenny off and say bye. I was at work.
