## Lenny loves baguettes

Lenny loves to call me during the day. More often than not, when he calls i'm working and vise versa. That doesn't stop Len from talking. Coz he's a talker.   
Topics Lenny brought up when he rang today (1) Running for local council (2) opening a bread shop (3) wealth inequality (4)moving house.

He would have gone on but i had to get back to work.
